<p><strong>Psycroptic</strong> are a technical death metal band from Tasmania, Australia. Formed in Hobart in 1999, their style originally took influence from 
    sub-genre styles of metal such as <em>'death'</em>, <em>'black'</em> and <em>'progressive'</em>. Their music is focused heavily on technical guitar and drum sections,
    never being displayed in form as traditional instrumental solos, rather as <em>'voices'</em> or <em>'breakdowns'</em> admist versus and choruses. As the 
    band grew, they incorporated elements from the subgenre of <em>'metalcore'</em> to simplify their song structures for a more digestible listen, 
    however maintained their ferocity and technical foundation.
